I have had an internship at a biotechnology company BioLizard as a machine learning intern. 
We have worked on protein catalytic site prediction according to their 3D shaped atoms.
I have coded this algorithm with Python and I have used Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries.
Thank you for take a look to my code :)
